2. Connect Your Experiences to Your Values

- Traveling has deepened my appreciation for cultural diversity and reinforced my commitment to sustainable tourism.

- In a Panchmarhi, I learned to cook some their famous dishes from a local grandmother, a memory I cherish.

- During a solo trek in Panchmarhi, I encountered a group of monks who shared their wisdom over a cup of tea.
