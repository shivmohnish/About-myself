    <p id="intro">Pachmarhi is a hill station in the <b>Hoshangabad district</b> of Madhya Pradesh state of central India. It has been the location of a cantonment (Pachmarhi Cantonment) since the British Raj.[2] The municipality is located in a valley of the Satpura Range and is widely known as Satpura ki Rani. ("Queen of Satpura")</p>
   
    
    The region was part of the Bhonsle Kingdom and was later ruled by the Marathas in the 18th century. <br>
    UNESCO added the Pachmarhi area to its list of Biosphere Reserves in May 2009, due to the many rare plant species in the vicinity. The total area of Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is 4981.72 km2, and it is located at latitude 22° 11’ to 22° 50’N and longitude 77° 47’ to 78° 52’E. <br>
    
    
    <p>It was later part of the Gondi kingdom of Bhagvat Singh in the 19th century, although there was no permanent settlement at that time. The origins of modern Panchmarhi can be traced back to 1857, when Captain James Forsyth of the British Army and Subhedar Major Nathoo Ramji Powar noticed the plateau while en route to Jhansi.[4] It quickly developed into a hill station and sanatorium for British troops in the Central Provinces of India, and Powar was made Kotwal.

    In 1901, the year-round population was 3,020, with a population of double this number during the hot summer months. Pachmarhi served as the summer capital for the Central Provinces. <br>
    
    <p id="Geographical"><b>Pachmarhi</b> has an altitude of 1067. Dhupgarh, the highest point (1,352 meters) in Madhya Pradesh and the Satpura range, is located nearby. The town is wholly located within the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve and the Satpura Tiger Reserve. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pachmarhi, also known as Satpura ki Rani, is a hill station in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Its many waterfalls include Apsara Vihar, with its calm pool, and soaring, single-drop Silver Fall nearby. The Bee Fall tumbles over a jagged rock face to the northwest.  <br>
