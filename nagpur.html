    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nagpur is a large city in the central Indian state of Maharashtra. The 19th-century Nagpur Central Museum displays items found locally, including fossils, sarcophagi and Mughal weaponry. The Raman Science Centre has hands-on exhibits and a planetarium. Sitabuldi Fort, in the Sitabuldi Hills, was the site of an 1817 battle. To the southwest, the immense, domed Deekshabhoomi is a Buddhist monument and pilgrimage site. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is famous for Nagpur oranges and is sometimes known as the Orange City for being a major trade centre of oranges cultivated in large part of the region.[33] It is also called the Tiger Capital of India or the Tiger Gateway of India as many tiger reserves are located in and around the city and also hosts the regional office of National Tiger Conservation Authority.[34][35] The city was founded in 1702 by the Gond King Bakht Buland Shah of Deogarh[36] and later became a part of the Maratha Empire under the royal Bhonsale dynasty. The British East India Company took over Nagpur in the 19th century and made it the capital of the Central Provinces and Berar. After the first re-organisation of states, the city lost its status as the capital. Following the informal Nagpur Pact between political leaders, it was made the second capital of Maharashtra. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the earlier names of Nagpur was "Fanindrapura". It derives its origin from the Marathi word pha·πáa (transl.‚Äâhood of a cobra). Nagpur's first newspaper was named Fanindramani, which means a jewel that is believed to be suspended over a cobra's hood. It is this jewel that lights up the darkness, hence the name of the newspaper.[38] B. R. Ambedkar claimed that both the city and the river are named after the 'Nags' who were opponents of the Indo-Aryans.[39] During British rule, the name of the city was spelt and pronounced as "Nagpore".  <hr>
